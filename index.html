        <p>You are looking at a handmade raytracer. A cube is defined in 3D. Each frame, a ray is projected from each and every pixel in the view port into the 3D world. If it intersects a face, then the pixel that cast the ray is coloured the colour of that face. In the case of multiple intersections, the nearest face is used.</p>

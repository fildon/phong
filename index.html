        <p>You are looking at a handmade raytracer. Two triangles are defined in 3D. Each frame, a ray is projected from each and every pixel in the view port into the 3D world. If it intersects a triangle, then the pixel that cast the ray is coloured the colour of that triangle. In the case of multiple intersections, the nearest triangle is used. For animation, just one point is being translated.</p>
        <p>Although a fun experiment in building a raytracer, it is proof that raytracing is far from efficient for real time purposes. A rasterizer would produce equally good results much faster.</p>
